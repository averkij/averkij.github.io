# Data science portfolio by Sergei Averkiev

- ‚ö° Currently I'm evolving in the field of ML and DevOps/MLOps.
- üå± My main interests in this area are NLP and RecSys.
- üòÑ Besides my work I like to learn languages (Russian, English, German, Czech, Hungarian, Japanese).
- üí¨ Ask me about how to pronounce "K√∂sz√∂n√∂m" in Hungarian and what does ‰æç mean.

I'm also writing articles time to time:

This portfolio is a compilation of projects and notebooks which I created for data analysis or for exploration of machine learning algorithms. A separate category is for separate projects.
